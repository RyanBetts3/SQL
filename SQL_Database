SQL

Data Retrieval (SELECT):

Retrieves data from tables.
Basic syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
Retrieve all columns: SELECT * FROM table_name;
Alias columns: SELECT column1 AS alias1, column2 AS alias2, ... FROM table_name;
Filtering Data (WHERE):

Filters rows based on conditions.
Syntax: SELECT ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Conditions: Use comparison operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=) and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
Ordering Data (ORDER BY):

Sorts results by a specific column.
Syntax: SELECT ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name [ASC | DESC];
ASC (default): Ascending order.
DESC: Descending order.
Aggregation (Functions):

Perform calculations on groups of data.
Common functions:
AVG(expr): Average value.
COUNT(expr): Count of rows (or non-null values).
MAX(expr): Maximum value.
MIN(expr): Minimum value.
SUM(expr): Sum of values.
Used with GROUP BY clause to group data before applying functions.
Joining Tables:

Combines data from multiple tables.
Types of joins:
INNER JOIN: Returns rows where there's a match in both tables based on the join condition.
LEFT JOIN: Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN: Includes all rows from both tables.


1. Basic search using LIKE
SELECT * FROM Test
WHERE UserId = 'Email'
AND services like '%vpn%';


2. Counting Data
SELECT IPAddress, COUNT(*) as Count
FROM Test
WHERE UserId = 'Email'
GROUP BY IPAddress
ORDER BY count;



3. Creating one table from 3 tables of UAL data
CREATE TABLE AdExEnriched AS
SELECT	AD.CreationTime,
		AD.ClientIp AS IPAddress,
		AD.Workload,
		AD.Operation,
		AD.ResultStatus,
		AD.UserId,
		AD.LogonError,

		AD.ExtendedProperties, 
		AD.ApplicationId,
		IP."results.data.as.organization" AS isp,
		IP."results.data.location.country" AS countryCode,

LEFT JOIN IPEnrichment as IP
