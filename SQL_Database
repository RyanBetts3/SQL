SQL

1. Basic search using LIKE
SELECT * FROM Test
WHERE UserId = 'Email'
AND services like '%vpn%';


2. Counting Data
SELECT IPAddress, COUNT(*) as Count
FROM Test
WHERE UserId = 'Email'
GROUP BY IPAddress
ORDER BY count;



3. Creating one table from 3 tables of UAL data
CREATE TABLE AdExEnriched AS
SELECT	AD.CreationTime,
		AD.ClientIp AS IPAddress,
		AD.Workload,
		AD.Operation,
		AD.ResultStatus,
		AD.UserId,
		AD.LogonError,
		AD.ErrorNumber, 
		AD.ExtendedProperties, 
		AD.ApplicationId,
		IP."results.data.as.organization" AS isp,
		IP."results.data.location.country" AS countryCode, 
		IP."results.data.services" AS services, 
		IP."results.data.risks" As risks, 
		IP."results.data.client.behaviors" AS behaviors,
		NULL AS OperationProperties,
		NULL AS ClientInfoString,
		NULL AS ResultStatus,
		NULL AS MailboxOwnerUPN,
		NULL AS Folder, 
		NULL AS Folders,
		NULL AS Item, 
		NULL AS AffectedItems, 
		NULL AS SessionId
FROM AAD as AD
LEFT JOIN IPEnrichment as IP
ON AD.ClientIp = IP.ip
 
UNION
 
SELECT 	EX.CreationTime,
		EX.ClientIPAddress, 
		EX.Workload, 
		EX.Operation, 
		EX.ResultStatus, 
		EX.UserId,
		NULL AS LogonError,
		NULL AS ErrorNumber, 
		NULL AS ExtendedProperties, 
		EX.AppId,
		IP."results.data.as.organization" AS isp,
		IP."results.data.location.country" AS countryCode, 
		IP."results.data.services" AS services, 
		IP."results.data.risks" As risks, 
		IP."results.data.client.behaviors" AS behaviors,
		EX.OperationProperties,
		EX.ClientInfoString,
		EX.ResultStatus,
		EX.MailboxOwnerUPN,
		EX.Folder, 
		EX.Folders,
		EX.Item, 
		EX.AffectedItems, 
		EX.SessionId
FROM Exchange AS EX
LEFT JOIN IPEnrichment AS IP
ON EX.ClientIPAddress = IP.ip
